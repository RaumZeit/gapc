Before installing you can check out the domain specific language
GAP-L and it's compiler GAP-C via:

    http://gapc.eu/

## Binary Install ##

It is recommended to install gapc from the distribution's package manager,
unless you want to develop gapc.

### Ubuntu ###

https://launchpad.net/~g-sauthoff/+archive/ppa

### Fedora Core ###

https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=bellmansgapc&project=home%3Agsauthof

### Other ###

For other .rpm or .deb based distributions write me an email or check out the
linked .spec file or source package.


## Compile and Install ##

1. look into doc/deps and install the missing dependencies

   (you can also consult the corresponding source package for up-to-date
    distribution specific dependencies)

2. copy a config file template from config/ to config.mf and adjust the settings

   set at least the PREFIX var

   example templates:

      config/example_local.mf - standard Linux system with
                                or without local boost installation
      config/solaris.mf - Solaris 10 with custom GCC
      config/sun.mf - Solaris 10 with Sun CC
                         Sun CC 12 with current patches is needed
                         not recommended for performance reasons
      ...

3. make
4. make install


Optional:

3.5. make test-unit  (quick, no codegen test)
3.6. make test-paral (takes time, needs ghc, comprehensive codegen test)
